<h3>Program Co-Chairs' Message </h3>

<p>It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 25th Annual Network
& Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2018), held at the
Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa in San Diego, CA, United States from
February 18-21, 2018. Twenty-five years represents a major milestone
for any conference, and we are proud that NDSS continues to help
lead the discussion on innovative techniques to secure the world's
most important systems. Our goal continues to be impact, especially
in the form of practical and relevant solutions. It is our hope
that the papers included in this program are the starting point of
the crucial conversations necessary to enable the Internet community
to apply, deploy, and advance the state of network and distributed
systems security technologies.

<p>This year NDSS received 331 complete submissions (i.e., not
counting papers that clearly violated the submission guidelines).
Submissions were evaluated on the basis of their technical quality,
novelty, and significance. Multiple rounds of reviewing culminated
in a one-day in-person program committee meeting in Miami, at which
71 papers (approximately 21%) were selected to appear in the program.
We note that this represents the largest program ever presented at
the conference, and have intentionally expanded the program to
better accommodate our burgeoning community. We strongly encourage
the program committees for related venues to do the same.

<p>Organizing a conference as large as NDSS is a substantial endeavor,
and we would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone who
contributed her or his time and effort. We'd also like to specifically
thank a few individuals who made particular contributions to NDSS
2018. Karen O'Donoghue served as a valuable interface between the
Program Committee Chairs, the Organizing Committee and ISOC.  We
continued our single day PC meeting experiment this year with great
success. Selcuk Uluagac and his students (Hidayet Aksu, Leonardo
Babun, Abbas Acar and Amit Sikder) hosted the PC meeting at Florida
International University in Miami, and were largely responsible for
one of the best run meetings we have ever attended.  We would also
like to thank Joseph Choi and Luis Vargas (UF) for their assistance
on the ground during the PC meeting, and Yan Ji (Cornell Tech) for
creating a scheduling tool for the meeting.

<p>Also crucial to our success was the creation of a Reviewing Task
Force, whose job was to ensure that reviews were as constructive
and fair as possible. PC members strove to serve as mentors instead
of gatekeepers, not only attempting to select the best possible
program for our diverse community, but also to assist authors of
the rejected papers in improving their work. We believe that this
philosophical change is important to improving open and equitable
dialog in the community.

<p>Finally, thanks to David Balenson, the Publications Chair, for
his efforts and persistence in producing these proceedings. We would
also like to thank everyone who served on the program committee and
put in the time both to review papers and travel to the PC meeting.
It was our pleasure and honor to have worked with you to put together
the program for NDSS 2018. Also crucial to the success of NDSS are
the authors who submitted papers and the attendees, without whom
NDSS would not be possible. Welcome to NDSS 2018!
