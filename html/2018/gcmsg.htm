<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 25th Annual Network
and Distributed System Security Symposium.

<p>We celebrate the 25th anniversary of NDSS with a richer program
than ever before: four workshops, more technical papers than in
past years, exciting keynotes, and a poster session.

<p>This year we have four co-located workshops: Workshop on Binary
Analysis Research (BAR), Workshop on Decentralized IoT Security
and Standards (DISS), Workshop on DNS Privacy (DNSPRIV), and
Workshop on Usable Security (USEC). The workshops encompass critical
topics in network and distributed systems security, some long
established as important research areas (as represented by BAR,
DNSPRIV, and USEC) and others that recently emerged (as represented
by DISS). I'd like to thank Matthew Smith and Mathias Payer, the
Workshops Co-Chairs, and Karen O'Donoghue, Steering Group Co-Chair,
for bringing together such an exciting set of workshops.

<p>Building on recent success, this year we're continuing the
tradition of organizing a poster session to showcase both in-progress
and exciting recent work in various aspects of computer security.
Thanks are due to Adam Aviv and Ting-Fang Yen, the Poster Co-Chairs,
for making sure we have an excellent poster program.

<p>Due to increased interest in our field and in NDSS, more papers
will be presented at NDSS this year than in any past year, yielding
a particularly exciting program. Selecting the papers is a task
that involves many people and many hours of hard work. I'd like
to thank Program Committee Co-Chairs Patrick Traynor and Alina
Oprea for the tremendous amount of work they donated and the
excellent job they've done in putting together this year's program.

<p>Many individuals have contributed to making NDSS a success,
including everyone on the Steering Group, Organizing Committee,
and the Internet Society and Association Management Solutions
staff. I'd like thank all of them for contributing their time and
effort.

<p>NDSS is possible in large part thanks to our generous sponsors.
I'd like to thank Baidu, Cisco, Check Point Software Technologies,
the Internet Society, and Qualcomm for their support, and the
Internet Society additionally for hosting the symposium. Funds for
our student grants were provided by the National Science Foundation
and the Internet Society.

<p>Finally, thank you, all, for participating in the symposium
and through that adding the key ingredient that makes NDSS a
success. I wish you all an excellent 25th NDSS!
