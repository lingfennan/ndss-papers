<h3>Program Co-Chairs' Message </h3>

<p> It is our great pleasure to present to you the technical program of the 26th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2019), held at the Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa in San Diego, CA, USA on February 24-27, 2019. For the past 26 years NDSS has established itself as one of the top conferences in systems and network security. Papers published at NDSS have made significant impact on research and practice, as exemplified by the inaugural awardees of the NDSS Test-of-Time Award. Our goal continues to be "impact", especially in the form of novel and practical solutions and techniques in cyber security. We hope that the papers in this year's program reflect the same strong potential in securing real-world networks and systems.

<p> This year we received a record of 521 complete submissions (i.e., not counting papers that clearly violated the submission guidelines). Submissions were evaluated on the basis of their technical quality, novelty, and significance. Multiple rounds of reviewing culminated in a one-day in-person program committee meeting in Boston, MA on November 2, 2018. At the end of the meeting 89 papers (17% acceptance rate) were selected to appear in the program, the largest in NDSS history. We strove to make the review process a competitive but constructive one. Program Committee (PC) members were regularly reminded to identify positive points in a submission and provide concrete suggestions to improve each paper. For each author rebuttal, we required that the corresponding reviews be updated to respond to the rebuttal. Continuing last year's practice, we appointed a Review Task Force (RTF) to help enforce the quality, timeliness, and responsiveness of the review process.

<p> Organizing a conference as large as NDSS is a substantial endeavor, and we would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone who contributed her or his time and effort. We would like to specifically thank a few individuals who made particular contributions to NDSS 2019. General Chair Trent Jaeger oversaw the entire conference and worked closely with us for Keynote Speaker invitation and Test-of-Time Award nomination (he chaired the Award Committee). Karen O'Donoghue served as a critical interface between Program Co-Chairs, the Organizing Committee and ISOC. Publicity Chair Adam Bates worked seamlessly with us to solicit submissions and promote the conference. Publications Chair David Balenson took good care of the proceedings production matters. We continued our single day, dual-track PC meeting experiment this year with great success. Alina Oprea and several Northeastern PhD students (Ahmet Buyukkayhan, Matthew Jagielski, Talha Ongun, and Giorgio Severi) hosted the PC meeting at Northeastern University in Boston, and were largely responsible for the very smooth and productive meeting. We would also like to thank the Northeastern Events team and Aanjhan Ranganathan for their assistance on the ground during the PC meeting, and Yan Ji (Cornell Tech) for creating a scheduling tool for the meeting.

<p> Last but not least, we would like to thank our PC members who have contributed significant time and effort to the creation of the technical program. It has been our privilege working with them. Finally, we thank all authors who submitted to NDSS 2019 and all attendees who are here at NDSS 2019, without whom NDSS would not be possible. Enjoy the conference!
