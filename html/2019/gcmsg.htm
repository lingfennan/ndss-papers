<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2019 Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS)
Symposium.

<p>NDSS 2019 continues its growth with its largest program ever: the most technical papers in its
history, four workshops, an exciting keynote, and poster session.

<p>This year we have five co-located workshops: Workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR), Workshop on
Decentralized IoT Systems and Security (DISS), Workshop on Measurements, Attacks, and Defenses for the
Web (MADWeb), and Workshop on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC). The workshops encompass critical
topics in network and distributed systems security, some established at  NDSS (BAR, DISS, and USEC) and
one new one this year (MADWeb). I'd like to thank Mathias Payer and Giulia Fanti, the Workshops Co-
Chairs, and Karen O'Donoghue, Steering Group Co-Chair, for bringing together such an exciting set of
workshops.

<p>Building on recent successes, this year we're continuing the tradition of organizing a poster
session to showcase both in-progress and exciting recent work in various aspects of computer security.
Thanks are due to Adam Aviv and Gang Tan, the Poster Co-Chairs, for making sure we have an excellent
poster program.

<p>Due to increased interest in our field and in NDSS, we have seen another record number of papers
submitted to NDSS -- nearly 100 more than the previous record -- but even better, we have had a
significant increase in the papers accepted -- over 25% more than the previous record. As a result,
many exciting papers on a wide range of computer security topics will be presented at NDSS this year.
Selecting the papers is a task that involves many people and many hours of hard work. I'd like to
thank Program Committee Co-Chairs Alina Oprea and Dongyan Xu for the tremendous amount of work they
donated and the excellent job they've done in putting together this year's program.

<p>New this year is the first NDSS Test-of-Time Award highlighting the NDSS papers identified as having
the greatest scientific and/or practical impact that were published prior to 2009. I want to thank the
Time-of-Time Award committee for their work efforts, including the current Program Committee Co-Chairs,
Alina Oprea and Dongyan Xu, along with David Balenson, Z. Morley Mao, and Paul Syverson.

<p>Many individuals have contributed to making NDSS a success, including everyone on the Steering
Group, Organizing Committee, and the Internet Society and Association Management Solutions staff. I'd
like thank all of them for contributing their time and effort.

<p>NDSS is possible in large part thanks to our generous sponsors. I'd like to thank Baidu, Check Point
Software Technologies, Cisco, Google, and Qualcomm. I also thank the Internet Society additionally for
hosting the symposium and providing funds for our student grants.

<p>Finally, thank you for participating in the symposium and contributing to making NDSS a success.
wish you all an excellent NDSS 2019!
