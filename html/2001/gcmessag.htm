General Chair's Message</h2></center>
Welcome to the eighth annual Internet Society (ISOC) Network and Distributed
System Security (NDSS) Symposium!&nbsp; Each year, this symposium brings
together researchers, designers, implementers, and users of network and
distributed system security technologies to discuss important security
issues, challenges, and solutions.&nbsp; The NDSS'01 Program Committee
has assembled an excellent mix of technical papers and invited talks that
describe promising new approaches to Internet-type security.&nbsp; Our
world continues to become more dependent on the Internet, and the need
for widespread deployment of usable and effective network and distributed
system security solutions is increasing just as rapidly.&nbsp; NDSS'01
is an opportunity to have open dialog, share experiences and ideas, and
explore solutions that will protect this valuable resource.
<p>This year's event has been organized by many people who have invested
considerable time and effort.&nbsp; The NDSS Steering Group, which I co-chaired
with Torryn Brazell and Lynn St. Amour from ISOC, has provided overall
leadership to ensure the success of NDSS'01. Carla Rosenfeld, Michele Estadt,
Terry Weigler and the staff at ISOC have done an outstanding job handling
registrations and many other behind-the-scenes activities.&nbsp; Tom Hutton
has again provided wonderful local arrangements.&nbsp; Mahesh Tripunitara
has coordinated inputs from the authors and speakers to assemble the hard-copy
proceedings and the easy-to-use CD-ROM proceedings.&nbsp; Dave Balenson
has once again handled the publicity details.&nbsp; Eric Harder did a great
job assembling a set of excellent instructors and timely tutorials. The
Program Co-Chairs, Avi Rubin and Paul Van Oorschot, and the entire Program
Committee are to be commended for their efforts in developing an excellent
technical program.&nbsp; Only with the collective hard work of all these
individuals are we able to make the symposium a success -- thanks to all
of you!
<p>Overall sponsorship has been provided for several years by the Internet
Society.&nbsp; In addition, we have received support this year from several
corporate sponsors.&nbsp; Thanks to the National Security Agency Office
of INFOSEC Research, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Entrust Technologies,
and Secure4Net for sponsoring NDSS'01.
<p>Finally, I would like to thank all of the authors who will present their
papers, the speakers who will share their knowledge and experiences, and
everyone who attends NDSS'01 for your contributions and participation.&nbsp;
I am confident that the professional contacts you make at this symposium,
the presentations, and these proceedings will provide ideas and insights
that you can apply to your own security efforts.
