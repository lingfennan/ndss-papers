<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>

<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 24th Annual Network
& Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2017), held at the
Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa in San Diego, CA, United States from
February 26 - March 1, 2017. NDSS fosters information exchange among
researchers and practitioners of network and distributed system
security. The target audience includes those interested in practical
aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus
on actual system design and implementation. A major goal is to
encourage and enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and
advance the state of network and distributed systems security
technologies.  

<p>This year NDSS received a record 423 valid submissions
(i.e., not counting papers that clearly violated the submission
guidelines). Submissions were evaluated on the basis of their
technical quality, novelty, and significance. Papers went through
three rounds of review. Reviewing culminated in a one-day in-person
program committee meeting, at which 68 papers (approximately 16%)
were selected to appear in the program.

<p>Organizing a conference as large as NDSS is a substantial endeavor,
and I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed
her or his time and effort. I'd also like to specifically thank a
few individuals who made particular contributions to NDSS 2017.
Karen O'Donoghue and Julie Rowland-Lane handled most of the logistics
of organizing the conference, as well as shepherding a new program
chair. Patrick Traynor served as the shadow chair; my job was made
easier by his being there to catch oversights. Yier Jin graciously
hosted the PC meeting at the University of Central Florida in
Orlando. This year we tried an experiment in which we ran the PC
meeting in two parallel tracks. Several students were especially
helpful in addressing the logistical challenges this experiment
involved. I'd like to thank Fan Zhang for his extensive technical
support, Grant Hernandez and Bradley Reaves for their assistance
on the ground, and Yan Ji for creating a scheduling tool for the
meeting. Thanks also to David Balenson, the Publications Chair, for
his efforts and persistence in producing the proceedings you have
before you. I'd also like to thank everyone who served on the program
committee and put in the time both to review papers and travel to
the PC meeting. It was my pleasure and honor to have worked with
you to put together the program for NDSS 2017. Also crucial to the
success of NDSS are the authors who submitted papers and the
attendees, without whom NDSS would not be possible. Welcome to NDSS
2017. I hope you find the program informative and stimulating.
