<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 24th Annual Network and
Distributed System Security Symposium.

<p>This year we have two collocated workshops: DNS Privacy Workshop
and Usable Security (USEC) Workshop. The workshops encompass two
critical topics in network and distributed systems security, privacy
and usability.  I'd like to thank Matthew Smith, the Workshop Chair,
and Karen O'Donoghue, Steering Group Co-Chair, for bringing
together such an exciting pair of workshops.

<p>Building on recent success, this year we're continuing the
tradition of organizing a poster session to showcase both in-progress
and exciting recent work in various aspects of computer security.
Thanks are due to Johanna Amann and Amir Houmansadr, the Poster
Co-Chairs, for making sure we have an excellent poster program.

<p>Due to increased interest in our field and in NDSS, more papers
will be presented at NDSS this year than in any past year, yielding
a particularly rich and exciting program.  Selecting the papers is
a task that involves many people and many hours of hard work. I'd
like to thank Ari Juels, the Program Chair, as well Patrick Traynor,
Shadow Program Chair, for the tremendous amount of work they donated
and the excellent job they've done in putting together this year's
program.

<p>Many individuals have contributed to making NDSS a success,
including everyone on the Steering Group, Organizing Committee, and
the Internet Society and Association Management Solutions staff.
I'd like thank all of them for contributing their time and effort.

<p>NDSS is possible in large part thanks to our generous sponsors.
I'd like to thank Baidu, Cisco, Afilias, Check Point Software
Technologies, Qualcomm, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Salesforce
for their support, and the Internet Society for hosting the symposium.
Funds for our student grants were provided by the National Science
Foundation and the Internet Society.

<p>Finally, thank you, all, for participating in the symposium and
through that adding the key ingredient that makes NDSS a success.
I wish you all an excellent 24th NDSS!
