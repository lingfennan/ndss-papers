<p>The papers in these proceedings were presented at the 13th annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, held on February 2-3, 2006 in San Diego. These papers were selected from 127 submissions in the area of computer and network security. The selected papers were chosen by a program committee of 22 experts in the field.</p>
<p>The selection process started shortly after the submission deadline. Each paper was assigned to at least three program committee members for review. The papers were evaluated based on scientific novelty, technical quality, and contribution to the field. Final selection of the 17 papers that appear in these proceedings took place at a program committee meeting on October 1st, 2005 in Redmond, Washington.</p>
<p>We are most grateful to the program committee members for their efforts in reviewing the large number of submissions to the conference. The committee produced over 360 printed pages of reviews. We also appreciate the efforts of the numerous outside reviewers who contributed reviews of individual papers at the request of members of the program committee.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers. We sincerely hope authors found the reviewers’ comments helpful. We would also like to thank the administrators of the Microsoft Research Conference Management Toolkit for running the paper submission review web site. Finally we would like to thank the Internet Society for their help in organizing this conference.</p>
