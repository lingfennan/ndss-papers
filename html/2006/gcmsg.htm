<p>I take great pleasure in welcoming you to the Thirteenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security.  Each year we gather together, as users, developers, and researchers, to discuss progress and exchange ideas in network security technologies.</p>
<p>Our program has always been flexible, adapting to changes in the network security field.  This year, our sessions cover advances in many current and emerging themes, including cryptography in network security, malicious behavior on the Web, Internet defense, and two Potpourri sessions (I am particularly gratified to see that the word "honeymonkey" is finally getting the profile it deserves).  This year, instead of guest speakers, we are having two panel discussions; remember your vegetables.  And, our pre-conference workshop on Malware and the Web, led by Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, promises vivid discussions.   Generally, so much of what we do depends upon secure and reliable computer systems; we seek to improve those systems by meeting here to present and discuss advances in the state of the science of network and distributed systems security.</p>
<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people.  The steering group, which I am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical.  Tom Hutton continues to do a superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Terry Weigler, with help from Michele Estadt, is magical with the logistics; the meeting simply would not happen without them.  Mudge bravely accepted the task of Workshop Chair, and continues the (short) tradition of Workshop excellence.  Doug Szajda skillfully coordinated the publications as Publications Chair.  Finally, I am grateful for the masterful work of Karen Seo as Publicity Chair.</p>
<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers selected to appear.  Under the leadership of the Program Co-Chairs, Dan Simon and Bill Arbaugh, the program committee chose an exceptional set of papers.  I thank Dan and Bill, and the entire program committee, for their expertise and dedication.  I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the speakers who present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for our several sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the National Security Agency (NSA) for patron sponsorship, Google and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for silver sponsorships, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for bronze sponsorship.  I appreciate your dedicated support.</p>
<p>Talk. Eat. Listen. Learn. I hope you enjoy the conference.</p>
