The papers in these proceedings were presented at the 12th annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium held February 3-4, 2005 in San Diego. These papers were selected from 124 submissions in the area of computer and network security. The selected papers were chosen by a program committee of 22 experts in the field. </p>
<p>The selection process started shortly after the submission deadline. Each paper was assigned to at least three program committee members for review. The papers were evaluated based on scientific novelty, technical quality, and contribution to the field. Final selection of the 16 papers that appear in these proceedings took place at a program committee meeting on October 4th, 2004 at Stanford University. </p>
<p>We are most grateful to the program committee members for their efforts in reviewing the large number of submissions to the conference. The committee produced over 350 pages of written reviews. We also appreciate the efforts of the numerous outside reviewers who contributed reviews of individual papers at the request of members of the program committee. </p>
<p>We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers. We sincerely hope authors found the reviewers' comments helpful. We would also like to thank Hovav Shacham for running the paper submission and review web sites. Finally, we would like to thank the Internet Society for their help in organizing this conference. </p>
