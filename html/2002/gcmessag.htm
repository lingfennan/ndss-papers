<h2> General Chair's Message</h2>
</center>
Welcome to the Ninth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed
Systems Security.&nbsp; This symposium provides a forum for researchers,
developers, and users of security technologies to discuss the latest advances
and exchange ideas.<br>
<br>
This year the topic of the symposium is particularly relevant as we have
seen significant increase in the incidence of attacks, ranging from viruses
and worms, denial of service attacks, and theft of credit card numbers from
e-commerce sites.&nbsp; The events of September 11th made us all feel vulnerable
to terrorist attacks in general, and increasing our level of discomfort about
the vulnerability of the computer systems on which we have become more dependent.<br>
<br>
This years symposium was made possible by the hard work of many people.&nbsp;
The steering group which I co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet
Society, continues to chart a course for the conference that keeps its focus
current, relevant, and practical.&nbsp; Once again, Tom Hutton coordinated
local arrangements, and we hope excellent weather, for the meeting.&nbsp;
Michele Estadt did a wonderful job handling the logistics for the meeting
with the assistance of Terry Weigler, making my job as general chair a breeze.&nbsp;
Eric Harder did a great job organizing a very relevant set of pre-conference
tutorials.&nbsp; Publicity for the symposium was coordinated aptly by David
Balenson and Martin Kupres lined up sponsors. Once again, Mahesh Tripunitara
coordinated input from the authors and assembled this years proceedings and
CD ROM.<br>
<br>
Long after the meeting is complete, the success of the conference will be
judged by the quality of the papers selected to appear.&nbsp; This selection
process was taken on by the program committee under the leadership of the
program co-chairs Paul Van Oorschot and Virgil Gligor.&nbsp; I thank Paul
and Virgil and the entire program committee for their hard work and for the
excellent program they have assembled.&nbsp; I would also like the thank
the authors who submitted and will present papers, and the panelist who will
speak during the symposium, for without them, there would not be a conference.<br>
<br>
It is with sadness that I report on the passing of Jim Ellis.&nbsp; Those
of you who have been regulars at this conference knew Jim as the General
Chair of the 1995 and 1996 symposia.&nbsp; Those of you who aren't regulars
probably know Jim from his role at the CERT (Computer Emergency Response
Team).&nbsp; Jim's leadership helped make this symposium what is is today
and I thank Jim for his guidance of the symposium in past years.<br>
<br>
The Internet Society provided overall sponsorship for the symposium and I
thank them for their support.&nbsp; Additionally, I would like to thank the
National Security Agency (NSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) and WareOnEarth for their sponsorship of the symposium.<br>
<br>
I am confident that the symposium will be productive, that you will make
new contacts and leave the symposium with new ideas.&nbsp; I encourage you
to develop those ideas when you go home and submit papers to next years symposium
telling us how you built upon those ideas to improve the security of your
systems and the new security technologies you have produced.&nbsp; Above
all, enjoy the conference.<br>
