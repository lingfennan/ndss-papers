<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Eighteenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and 
Distributed Systems Security, and to the Dana on Mission Bay.  Those fortunate enough to have 
attended NDSS 2008 and NDSS 2010  know first-hand the fine facilities and exceptional staff of 
the Dana.  We are pleased to be back, and look forward to many successful future NDSS meetings here.</p>
<p>It seems that every NDSS meeting introduces some changes.  One feature that has remained consistent 
throughout the history of NDSS, however, is the superior quality of the technical program.  Our 
research domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid theoretical 
foundations.  The program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical 
and the pressing need. This scope, along with a willingness to consider potentially controversial 
or unusual research, is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>
<p>The program for this year includes nine sessions and 28 papers covering a variety of current 
security topics, including security in emerging applications, such as social networks and 
smartphones; wireless networks; operating system security; network malware; software security and 
code analysis; web security; cloud computing; and privacy.  We are also especially fortunate to 
have Liam O Murchu, Stuxnet Worm expert and Symantec's Manager of Security Response Operations 
for North America, as our keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Though the technical presentations are the heart of NDSS, there is far more to the experience.  
The hall track, meeting new colleagues, asking questions, and participating in discussions are 
invaluable parts of the process of disseminating and discussing information. Take advantage of 
them.  Remember also to take advantage at some point of the superior geographic location.</p>
<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. The steering group, which I 
am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for 
the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical.  Tom Hutton has once again 
done a superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of 
helping plan and publicize the conference.  Terry Weigler is magical with the logistics. Andrew 
White skillfully coordinated the publications as Publications Chair.  This meeting is as enjoyable 
and successful as it is because of the efforts of these people -- it is no exaggeration to say 
that NDSS simply would not happen without each of their contributions.</p>
<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers accepted.  The 
program committee, under the direction of Program Chair Adrian Perrig has selected an 
extraordinary set of papers.  I thank Adrian and the entire program committee for their 
expertise, hard work, and dedication.  I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the 
speakers who present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the National 
Security Agency (NSA) for Patron sponsorship; Afilias and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) 
for Silver sponsorships; Google, Microsoft Research, and IBM Research for Bronze sponsorships, and 
IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor.  The conference is organized, as always, 
by the Internet Society, and for the first time this year the conference is organized in 
cooperation with USENIX.</p>
<p>This is my fourth and final year as General Chair of NDSS. It has been my pleasure to serve, and 
it has been my pleasure to meet and work with some of the finest minds in computer security and 
with some of the finest people I know.  I have also been fortunate enough to contribute to a 
meeting that I feel is very important to the computer security community.  This conference 
thrives because of the efforts of all of the individuals involved.  So as my final comment as 
chair, I ask that if you share the opinion that this meeting has much to offer, then become 
involved.  I guarantee you that it will be entertaining and very much worth your time and effort.</p>
