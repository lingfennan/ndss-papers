<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>These proceedings contain the 28 papers presented at the 18th Annual Network and Distributed System 
Security Symposium (NDSS), held at The Dana on Mission Bay, San Diego, California, on February 6 to 
9, 2011. The symposium was sponsored by the Internet Society (ISOC). Since inception, NDSS has been 
a premier forum to present the latest developments in computer and network security research, 
bringing together researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>This year, a total of 139 papers were submitted. The overall quality of the papers was excellent. 
With the maturing of the security field, one would expect an increase in the overall quality of 
the work. Consequently, we aimed for a higher acceptance rate, in order to publish more of the 
high-quality research of the security community. However, given the inherently adversarial nature 
of security researchers, increasing the rate of acceptance is no easy task. We applied three 
approaches to accomplish this: careful selection of Program Committee (PC) members who are 
particularly supportive of creative works, encouragement of PC members to identify papers with 
novel and innovative approaches, and initial discussion and rejection of weaker papers at the PC 
meeting which helps to highlight the merits of the stronger papers leading to easier acceptance 
decisions. Fortunately, these approaches appeared to work very well, and resulted in the 28 
accepted papers (20% acceptance rate) that you find in these proceedings.</p>
<p>The PC meeting was held on October 4, 2011, co-located with the workshops and tutorials on the 
first day of the ACM CCS conference to facilitate attendance by PC members. Almost all PC members 
were physically present, remote members joined the discussions through a teleconferencing system. 
Special thanks go to Ahren Studer for setting up the review system and supporting the PC meeting. 
Thanks to an on-line elimination of the weakest papers and strict time control at the meeting, we 
were able to discuss every submission (following the "no paper left behind" act). Thanks to the 
approaches described above, we had solidly accepted 26 papers by the end of the day, with a few 
papers still pending additional discussions. Given the diversity of the PC, the accepted papers 
represent a variety of fields of security, especially the strong representation of network 
security and distributed systems related papers in the program.</p>
<p>As a good indication of the breadth of research in computer and network security, the papers 
cover diverse topic areas: wired and wireless network security, OS security, software security, 
malware analysis, web security, distributed systems and networks, network malware, privacy, cloud 
computing, social networks, smart phone security, and biometrics.</p>
<p>In addition to these papers, the symposium program also features a fascinating keynote 
presentation by Liam O Murchu from Symantec on Stuxnet.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the organizing committee, the program committee, the steering group, the 
ISOC staff, and most importantly, the authors of all the papers submitted to the symposium. With 
the community's help and continued support, NDSS will remain an exciting and successful venue.</p>
