<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to
welcome you all back to the beautiful Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa on Mission
Bay in San Diego for the Internet Society's Network and Distributed System
Security Symposium (NDSS'13). This year’s meeting is a milestone for us and we
thank you for helping us celebrate the Twentieth Anniversary of what started
out as the &quot;PSRG Workshop on Network and Distributed System Security.&quot;
That informal two-day workshop, held right here at the Catamaran on February
11-12, 1993, was such a unique and successful event that we are now in our 20th
year. We still offer a unique and highly intellectual symposium. Many thanks to
the original workshop chairman, Dan Nessett, then of Lawrence Livermore
National Labs, along with the 1992 PSRG, for creating such a high quality and
successful symposium, one that I hope continues another 20 years and more. I
wish to especially recognize NDSS’ previous chairs: Dan Nessett (1993-94),
James Ellis (1995-96), David Balenson (1997-98), Steve Welke (1999-01), Cliff
Neuman (2002-04), Eric Harder (2005-07), and Doug Szajda (2008-11).</p>

<p>I would like to thank
the Catamaran Resort for providing such an excellent venue. Even though we have
switched venues several times over the last twenty years, I’m not sure we would
be here today without the help of the fantastic staff of this facility. Their
willingness to allow a no-name, informal group of security and network
researchers to reserve their meeting and hotel rooms back in 1993 with
virtually no collateral or history is what allowed this symposium to be
born.</p>

<p>From our very first
workshop and continuing today, NDSS has striven to maintain the superior
quality of our technical program. Our research domain continues to emphasize
practical applications of security based on solid theoretical foundations. The
program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical
and the pressing need. This scope, along with a willingness to consider
potentially controversial or unusual research, is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>

<p>The program for this
year packs a lot into three days and includes twelve sessions and forty-seven
original research papers. They cover a variety of current topics such as the
security and privacy of mobile devices, cloud computing, distributed systems and
networks, web security and privacy, intrusion detection and attack analysis,
anonymity, and more. Our three keynote speakers are: Dr. Richard Kemmerer,
Computer Science Leadership Chair at University of California Santa Barbara;
Stephen Smalley of the Trusted Systems Research Group at the US National
Security Agency (NSA); and Joe Sullivan, Chief Security Officer of Facebook.
The Program Committee has also included twelve short talks.</p>

<p>Although the
symposium revolves around the technical presentations, there is far more to the
experience. You are encouraged to take advantage of the hall track, the
lunches, and the dinners to meet new colleagues. Participate in discussions, always
an invaluable part of disseminating information. Remember also to take in our fantastic
geographic location.</p>

<p>This symposium is
possible only through the hard work of many people. The Steering Group, which I
am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly
charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and
practical. Andrew M. White skillfully assembled the Proceedings as
Publications Chair. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of finding sponsors
and helping plan and publicize the conference and Terry Weigler, as always has done
a fantastic job dealing with each and every one of you for Registration. This
meeting is as enjoyable and as successful as it is because of the efforts of
these people -- it is no exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen
without each of their contributions.</p>

<p>The quality of this
conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers and short talks
accepted. The Program Committee, under the direction of Program Chair Peng Ning
of North Carolina State University, has done a fantastic job and selected an
extraordinary set of papers. I thank Peng and the entire Program Committee for
their expertise, hard work, and dedication. I also thank the authors who
submitted papers and the speakers who are present; YOU are the core of this
symposium.</p>

<p>I want to thank our
sponsors, as it would be impossible to hold such an event without them. Our
sponsors are the Internet Society for overall sponsorship, Internet2 for Gold
Sponsorship; Afilias, FishNet Security, Qualcomm, and the San Diego
Supercomputer Center @ UCSD (SDSC) for Silver sponsorship; Research at Google
and Microsoft Research for Bronze sponsorships, and IEEE Security and Privacy
Magazine as our media sponsor. The conference is organized by the Internet
Society, in cooperation with USENIX.</p>

<p>I
would also like to thank my organization, the San Diego Supercomputer Center at
the University of California San Diego, for supporting my involvement with this
symposium for the last twenty years. Finally, I want all of you to know that I consider
it a great honor to chair this conference, one where the attendees and speakers
are some of the finest minds in computer security. </p>
