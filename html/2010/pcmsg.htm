<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>These proceedings contain the 24 papers presented at the 17th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), held at The Dana on Mission Bay, San Diego, California, on February 28 to March 3, 2010. The symposium was sponsored by the Internet Society (ISOC). Since 1995, NDSS has been a premier forum to present the latest developments in computer and network security research, bringing together researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>This year, a total of 156 papers were submitted to NDSS. Selecting just a few of them to include in the symposium program was a very challenging task because many of these papers were interesting and impressive. The program committee (PC) is larger than in past years, and so we were able to assign more than three reviewers to many papers without overloading the PC members. As in the past, all reviews were anonymous. The submitted papers were discussed at the PC meeting held in Chicago, IL, on November 9, 2009. Almost all PC members were physically present at the meeting, which lasted close to 12 hours. The committee selected these 24 papers based on the originality and quality of the research, as well as its suitability to the symposium. We thank all PC members and external reviewers for their hard work and for their wisdom and professionalism.</p>
<p>As a good indication of the breadth of research in computer and network security, the papers cover diverse topic areas: Distributed Systems and Networks, Web Security and Privacy, Intrusion Detection and Attack Analysis, Anonymity and Cryptographic Systems, Security Protocols and Policies, Languages and Systems Security, Malware Analysis, and Spam Detection.</p>
<p>In addition to these papers, the symposium program also featured a keynote by former White House counterterrorism and cyber security czar Richard A. Clarke, and a special panel discussion on Ethics in Networking and Security Research.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the organizing committee, the program committee, the steering group, the ISOC staff, and most importantly, the authors of all the papers submitted to the symposium. Without your efforts and continued support, NDSS cannot be such a success.</p>
