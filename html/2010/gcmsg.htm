<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Seventeenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security, and to the Dana on Mission Bay.  Those fortunate enough to have attended NDSS 2008 know first-hand the fine facilities and exceptional staff of the Dana.  We are pleased to be back, and look forward to many successful future NDSS meetings here.</p>
<p>Though every NDSS meeting introduces some changes, one feature that has remained consistent during the history of NDSS is the superior quality of the technical program.  Our research domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid theoretical foundations.  The program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing need.  This scope, along with a willingness to consider potentially controversial or unusual research, is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>
<p>The program for this year includes sessions that cover web security and privacy, distributed systems, intrusion detection and attack analysis, spam, anonymity and cryptographic systems, security protocols and policies, languages and system security, and malware. We are also especially fortunate to have Richard A. Clarke, former White House Counterterrorism and Cyber Security Czar and currently Chairman of Good Harbor Consulting, as our keynote speaker.  There will also be a panel on ethics in networking and security research.  During these times of increasing computer related threats, it is especially important that those of us devoted to providing protection from these threats consider the potential harm of the solutions we develop.</p>
<p>Though the conference revolves around the technical presentation, there is much more to the experience.  The hall track, meeting new colleagues, asking questions, and participating in discussions are invaluable parts of the process of disseminating and discussing information.  Take advantage of them.  Remember also to take advantage at some point of the superior geographic location.</p>
<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. The steering group, which I am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical.  Tom Hutton has once again done a superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of helping plan and publicize the conference.  Terry Weigler is magical with the logistics. Barry Lawson skillfully coordinated the publications as Publications Chair.  This meeting is as enjoyable and successful as it is because of the efforts of these people -- it is no exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen without each of their contributions.</p>
<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers accepted.  The program committee, under the direction of Program Chair Wenke Lee has selected an extraordinary set of papers.  I thank Wenke and the entire program committee for their expertise, hard work, and dedication.  I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the speakers who present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the National Security Agency (NSA) for patron sponsorship, Afilias, Cisco, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for silver sponsorships, Google and Microsoft Research for bronze sponsorships, and IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor.  I appreciate your dedicated support.</p>
<p>This is my final year as General Chair of NDSS.  It has been my pleasure to serve, and it has been my pleasure to meet and work with some of the finest minds in computer security and with some of the finest people I know.  I have also been fortunate enough to contribute to a meeting that I feel is very important to the computer security community.  This conference thrives because of the efforts of all of the individuals involved.  So as my final comment as chair, I ask that if you share the opinion that this meeting has much to offer, then become involved.  I guarantee you that it will be entertaining and very much worth your time and effort.</p>
