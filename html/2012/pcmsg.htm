<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>I am happy to present to you these proceedings of the 2012 Network and Distributed System Security 
Symposium (NDSS), held on 5-8 February, 2012, at the Hilton Resort & Spa in San Diego, California.
</p>
<p>The symposium is organized by the Internet Society (ISOC) and this is its 19th instance. Since 
its inception in 1995, NDSS has been a premier forum on the latest developments in computer and 
network security research, bringing together both researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>This year, we are pleased to have received 317 submissions. After sanity checks and additional 
cleanup, a total of 258 excellent papers entered the double-blind reviewing process. A program 
committee meeting was co-hosted with the ACM CCS conference in Chicago. The PC had the difficult 
task of creating a program out of the large number of excellent submissions and accepted 46 research 
papers. Since a large number of excellent papers didn't make it in, I took upon myself the task of 
inviting all remaining highly-ranked submissions for a special invited short-talks session. 8 papers 
accepted my invitation. Overall, the following per country distributions apply:</p>
