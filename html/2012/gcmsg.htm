<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Nineteenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security, and to the Hilton Resort and Spa on Mission Bay.  Those of you fortunate enough to have attended last year will notice some important changes.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious is that we are at the Hilton Resort and Spa for the first time in NDSS's history.  All of you should be thanked for our growth and success that has allowed us to move to larger facilities.  We believe you will find facilities and staff exceptional.</p>

<p>The second change you should notice is that we have added an additional half day to the symposium in order to cover all the exciting papers.  This brings the meeting to three full days of material.</p>

<p>Every NDSS meeting introduces some changes.  One feature that has remained consistent throughout the history of NDSS, however, is the superior quality of the technical program.  Our research domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid theoretical foundations.  The program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing need. This scope, along with a willingness to consider potentially controversial or unusual research, is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>

<p>The program for this year includes fourteen sessions and 54 papers (almost double from last year) covering a variety of current security topics, including security in emerging applications, such as social networks, vehicular vulnerabilities and smart phones; wireless networks; operating system security; network malware; biometrics; program security and code analysis; web security; cloud computing; anonymity; cryptographic systems and privacy.  We are also especially fortunate to have four fantastic keynote speakers this year:  David Brin, scientist & award-winning science-fiction author;  Eric Grosse, Vice President of Security Engineering at Google; Stephen E. Schmidt, Chief Information Security Officer, Amazon Web Services and John N. Stewart, Vice President & Chief Security Officer, Cisco Systems Inc.</p>

<p>Though the symposium revolves around the technical presentations, there is far more to the experience.  The hall track, meeting new colleagues, asking questions, and participating in discussions are invaluable parts of the process of disseminating and discussing information. Take advantage of them.  Remember also to take advantage at some point of the superior geographic location.</p>

<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. The steering group, which I am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of helping plan and publicize the conference.  Andrew M. White skillfully assembled the Proceedings as Publications Chair with assistance from Terry Weigler.  This meeting is as enjoyable and successful as it is because of the efforts of these people -- it is no exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen without each of their contributions.</p>

<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers accepted.  The program committee, under the direction of Program Chair Radu Sion has done a fantastic job and has selected an extraordinary set of papers.  I thank Radu and the entire program committee for their expertise, hard work, and dedication.  I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the speakers who are present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>

<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors as it would be impossible to hold such an event without you.  Our sponsors are the Internet Society for overall sponsorship; Internet2 for Patron sponsorship; Afilias and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for Silver sponsorships; Microsoft Research and Google for Bronze sponsorships, and IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor.  The conference is organized by the Internet Society, in cooperation with USENIX.</p>

<p>This is my first year as General Chair of NDSS, moving up from my previous role as Local Arrangements Chair.  I would also like to personally thank Ex-Chair Doug Szajda for his help and for mentoring me in my new role.  I view it as a great honor to chair a conference where the attendees are some of the finest minds in computer security.</p>
