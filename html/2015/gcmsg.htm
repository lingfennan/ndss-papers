<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 22nd Internet Society
Symposium on Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS15).

<p>From our very first workshop and continuing today, NDSS has
striven to maintain the superior quality of our technical program.
Our research domain continues to emphasize practical applications
of security based on solid theoretical foundations. The program
stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical
and the pressing needs. This scope, along with a willingness to
consider potentially controversial or unusual research, is the
essential beauty of NDSS.

<p>Again for our second year we have optional SENT and USEC full-day
Workshops (Security of Emerging Network Technologies and Usable
Security) on Sunday. These will bring together academic and industry
researchers to discuss security problems, challenges, and potential
solutions of emerging networking technologies such as Software
Defined Networks, Named-Data-Networking and Cellular networks.

<p>The main program this year packs a lot into three full days and
includes 11 sessions. They cover a variety of current topics including
a 4-part multiple session on Detection, Analysis, Prevention and
Response. Other sessions cover such areas as Social and Cloud
Services, Privacy, Web Security and Mobile Security. Our keynote
speaker this year is Dr.  Stephen Farrell, a research fellow in the
department of Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin.

<p>Although the symposium revolves around the technical presentations,
there is far more to the experience. Take advantage of the hall
track, the reception, the lunches, and the Tuesday banquet to meet
new colleagues. These discussions are invaluable parts of the process
of disseminating and discussing information. And finally, remember
to save some time to enjoy our fantastic city.

<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many
people. I would like to thank following: the NDSS steering group
for charting a course for the conference that keeps its focus
current, relevant, and practical; the conference committee for
dealing with all the details to put together such an event and to
publish its proceedings; and the Internet Society and its staff for
their fantastic job with registration and all the work leading up
to the conference. This meeting is as enjoyable and as successful
as it is because of the efforts of these people -- it is no
exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen without each
of their contributions.

<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality
of the papers accepted. The program committee, under the direction
of Program Chair Engin Kirda of Northeastern University, has done
a fantastic job and has selected an extraordinary set of papers. I
thank Engin and the entire program committee for their expertise,
hard work, and dedication.  I also want to thank Adrian Perrig and
Gene Tsudik for organizing and chairing the SENT workshop and Jens
Grossklags for the organizing and chairing of the USEC workshop.
Lastly, I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the
speakers who are present; YOU are the core of this symposium.

<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors, as it would be impossible
to hold such an event without them. Our sponsors are the Internet
Society for overall sponsorship, Cisco Systems for Gold Sponsorship;
Afilias, Qualcomm, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center @ UCSD
(SDSC) for Silver sponsorship; Research at Google, IBM Research,
and Microsoft Research for Bronze sponsorships, and IEEE Security
and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor. The conference is organized
by the Internet Society, in cooperation with USENIX.

<p>I would also like to thank my organization, the San Diego
Supercomputer Center at the University of California San Diego, for
supporting my involvement with this symposium over the last 22
years.

<p>Finally, I want all of you to know that I view it as a great
honor to chair this conference, one where the attendees and speakers
are some of the finest minds in computer network security.
