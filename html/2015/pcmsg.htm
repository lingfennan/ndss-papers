<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>

<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 22nd Annual Network
& Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2015), held at the
Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa in San Diego, CA, United States on
February 8-11, 2015. I was very honored to chair this year's NDSS
-- a conference that fosters information exchange among researchers
and practitioners of network and distributed system security. The
target audience includes those interested in practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, with a focus on actual
system design and implementation. A major goal is to encourage and
enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the
state of network and distributed systems security technologies.

<p>This year, NDSS received 300 valid submissions (i.e., not counting
papers that clearly violated the submission guidelines). Submissions
were evaluated on the basis of their technical quality, novelty,
and significance. Papers went through two rounds of review. Reviewing
culminated in a one-and-a-half-day inperson program committee meeting
at Northeastern University in Boston, at which 50 papers (approximately
17%) were selected to appear at NDSS.

<p>Organizing a conference as large as NDSS is a substantial endeavor,
and I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed
his or her time and effort. I'd also like to specifically thank a
few individuals who made particular contributions to NDSS 2015.
Nicole Armstrong and Terry Weigler handled most of the logistics
of organizing the conference, as well as the task difficult task
of guiding a new program chair who was not familiar with the
organizational specifics of NDSS. Srdjan Capkun served as the shadow
chair and made my life as chair a lot easier with his advice,
suggestions, and oversight.  Also, it was great fun to work Srdjan.
Thanks chiefly to the efforts and persistence of David Balenson,
the Publications Chair, NDSS 2015 proceedings and papers have been
assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs), enabling easier search
and indexing. I would also like to thank everyone who accepted my
invitation to serve on the program committee. I was very impressed
because almost everyone was physically present at the PC meeting
in Boston. It was my pleasure and honor to have worked with you to
put together the program for NDSS 2015.  Also crucial to the success
of NDSS are the authors who submitted papers---thank you!---and the
attendees.  Welcome to NDSS, and I hope you find the program
informative and stimulating.
