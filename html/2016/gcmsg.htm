<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 23rd Annual Network and
Distributed System Security Symposium.

<p>I'm happy to report that this year's NDSS has the most content to
offer of any NDSS meeting so far.  Building on the success of
previous years, this year we have three collocated workshops: TLS
1.3 Ready or Not (TRON), Understanding and Enhancing Online Privacy
(UEOP), and Usable Security (USEC). The workshops span a broad
range, some focused on traditional academic research, others focused
on the concerns of practitioners; some publishing proceedings,
others more informal and interactive. I'd like to thank Matthew
Smith, the Workshop Chair, for bringing together such an exciting
set of workshops.

<p>Also building on recent success, we're this year continuing the
tradition of organizing a poster session to showcase both in-progress
and exciting recent work in various aspects of computer security.
Thanks are due to Manuel Egele and Michelle Mazurek, the Poster
Co-Chairs, for making sure we have an excellent poster program.

<p>Due to increased interest in our field and in NDSS, more papers
will be presented at NDSS this year than in any past year, yielding
a particularly rich and exciting program.  Selecting the papers is
a task that involves many people and many hours of hard work. I'd
like to thank Srdjan Capkun, the Program Chair, for the tremendous
amount of work he donated and the excellent job he's done in putting
together this year's program.

<p>Many individuals have contributed to making NDSS a success, including
everyone on the Steering Group, Organizing Committee, and many
Internet Society staff; all have my gratitude. I'd like to specifically
thank a few with whom I've worked closely and whose contributions
have been particularly noteworthy: Karen O'Donoghue and David
Balenson. Karen O'Donoghue has put in a tremendous amount of work
and dealt with an ever-growing number of minor crises and unforeseen
challenges in coordinating the Internet Society's role in organizing
the conference. David Balenson has regularly exceeded what was
expected of him, stepping in to help with tasks that weren't even
vaguely related to his role as Publications Chair.

<p>NDSS is possible in large part thanks to our generous sponsors. I'd
like to thank Cisco, Afilias, Check Point Software Technologies,
San Diego Supercomputer Center, Qualcomm and Mozilla for their
ongoing support, and the Internet Society for hosting the symposium.
Funds for our student grants were provided by the National Science
Foundation and the Internet Society.

<p>Finally, thank you, all, for participating in the symposium and
through that adding the key ingredient that makes NDSS a success.
I wish you all an excellent 23rd NDSS!
