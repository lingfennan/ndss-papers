<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 23nd Annual
Network & Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2016). This
year's edition of NDSS is held at the Catamaran Resort Hotel and
Spa in San Diego, CA, United States on February 21-24, 2016. NDSS
fosters information exchange among researchers and practitioners
of network and distributed system security. The target audience
includes those interested in practical aspects of network and
distributed system security, with a focus on actual system design
and implementation. A major goal is to encourage and enable the
Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of network
and distributed systems security technologies.

<p>NDSS is one of the prime security venues and I was honored to
chair this year's program committee. The committee consisted of 43
researchers with established track records in a broad range of
security and related topics. This year, NDSS received 389 submissions
which were evaluated on the basis of their technical quality,
novelty, and significance. Papers were evaluated in several rounds.
In order to allow authors time to improve their work and submit to
other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus
on rejection were notified after the first round of reviews and
discussions. The paper selection process was finalized during  a
one-and-a-half-day in-person program committee meeting in New York,
at which 60 papers (approximately 15.5%) were selected to appear
at NDSS 2016.

<p>Selecting a high-quality conference program is inherently a
community effort and I am grateful to all those who supported this
effort or actively took part in the selection process: Ari Juels
for shadow-chairing the event, for his effort, support and patience
- thanks Ari! Two Sigma for hosting the PC meeting in their amazing
premises. Nikos Karapanos and Claudio Marforio for setting up the
reviewing infrastructure, and for their assistance through the whole
process. Lujo Bauer for his advice and guidance. Terry Weigler and
Karen O'Donoghue for their logistical support. David Balenson, NDSS
Publications Chair for his effort with the proceedings. I would
further like to thank the program committee members for their great
work. It has been a true pleasure to work in such a committee.
Finally, great thanks to the authors who submitted their work to
NDSS, the attendees and the readers of these proceedings!
