  The papers in these proceedings were presented at the 11th annual Network and 
  Distributed System Security Symposium held on February 5-6, 2004 in San Diego. 
  These papers were selected from 98 submissions all in the area of computer and 
  network security. The selected papers were chosen by a program committee of 
  22 experts in the field.</p>
<p>The selection process started shortly after the submission deadline. Each paper 
  was assigned to at least three program committee members for review. The papers 
  were evaluated based on scientific novelty, contribution to the field, and technical 
  quality. The authors did not know the identity of the reviewers. In some cases, 
  advice was sought from colleagues outside the program committee. Final selection 
  took place at a program committee meeting on October 17th at the University 
  of Maryland. We are grateful to Bill Arbaugh for hosting the PC meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to papers printed here, the symposium included a keynote address 
  by Mike Garduno from MasterCard International who spoke about &quot;Hacks, Attacks 
  &amp; eCommerce Fraud,&quot; and a panel session on legal issues in computer 
  security.</p>
<p>We are most grateful to the program committee members for their efforts in 
  reviewing the large number of submissions to the conference. The committee produced 
  over 300 pages of written reviews. We would also like to thank all of the authors 
  who submitted papers. After all, it is the authors above all that make a conference 
  successful. For those authors whose papers did not quite make it, we sincerely 
  hope that they found the reviewers comments helpful.</p>
