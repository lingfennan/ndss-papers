  Welcome to the Eleventh Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed 
  System Security. This symposium provides a forum for researchers, developers, 
  and users of security technologies to discuss the latest advances and exchange 
  ideas.</p>
<p>This year the focus of the symposium has adapted to changes in the network 
  security field, focusing on current topics relevant to protecting computer systems. 
  We have a session on secure software, a discipline that if followed can eliminate 
  many of the too often exploited vulnerabilities that pop up every couple of 
  months. Recognizing that buggy code will likely continue to run for some time, 
  we have a session on intrusion detection. The conference topics are filled out 
  with discussion of authentication and security protocols. In the past couple 
  of years the world has become more concerned with the security of computer systems; 
  the developments discussed in this symposium will help us to address those concerns.</p>
<p>This year's symposium was made possible by the hard work of many people. The 
  steering group which I co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, 
  continues to chart a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, 
  relevant, and practical. Once again, Tom Hutton coordinated local arrangements. 
  Terry Weigler did a wonderful job handling the logistics for the meeting with 
  the assistance of Michele Estadt, making my job as general chair a breeze. Pre-conference 
  tutorials were coordinated this year by Doug Szajda.</p>
<p>Long after the meeting is complete, the success of the conference will be judged 
  by the quality of the papers selected to appear. This selection process was 
  taken on by the program committee under the leadership of the program co-chairs 
  Michael Reiter and Dan Boneh. I thank Mike and Dan and the entire program committee 
  for their hard work and for the excellent program they have assembled. I would 
  also like to thank the authors who submitted and will present papers, and the 
  panelist who will speak during the symposium, for without them, there would 
  not be a conference.</p>
<p>The Internet Society provided overall sponsorship for the symposium and I thank 
  them for their support. Additionally, I would like to thank the National Security 
  Agency (NSA) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for their sponsorship 
  of the symposium.</p>
<p>I am confident that you will make new contacts and leave the symposium with 
  new ideas. I encourage you to develop those ideas when you go home and submit 
  papers to next year's symposium telling us how you built upon those ideas to 
  improve the security of your systems and the new security technologies you have 
  produced. Above all, enjoy the conference.</p>
