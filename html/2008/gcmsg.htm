<h3>General Chair's Message </h3>
<p> It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Fifteenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security. Those of you who have attended in the past will notice some important changes.</p>
<p>The most obvious is that we are here at the Dana. San Diego is a wonderful city and in the Dana we are fortunate to have outstanding accommodations. In addition, the number of technical papers has been increased to 21 from 17. We hope to see that number rise to around 25 for future conferences. The reason we can do this without sacrificing quality is simple: the field of computer security is growing at a significant rate. We have also added a works-in-progress session. Finally, though we have retained the three day format of the conference, we have moved the primary technical session days to Monday through Wednesday, rather than Wednesday through Friday. This change provides greater flexibility for attendees, allowing those who may only be able to attend for a day or two to attend the conference without having to miss an entire week of classes or work.</p>
<p>One thing that has not changed is the superior quality of the technical program. Our research domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid theoretical foundations. The program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing need. This scope is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have two excellent invited speakers in Gary McGraw and Dan Kaminsky. In addition, a distinguished panel of experts will be discussing the increasing connection between virtualization and issues of security. These talks and the panel session hold the promise of providing valuable insights into important current and future security problems.</p>
<p>Though the conference revolves around the technical presentation, there is much more to the experience. The hall track, meeting new colleagues, asking questions, and participating in discussions are invaluable parts of the process of disseminating and discussing information. Take advantage of them. Remember also to take advantage at some point of the superior geographic location.</p>
<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. The steering group, which I am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical. Tom Hutton continues to do a superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of helping plan and publicize the conference. Terry Weigler is magical with the logistics. Barry Lawson skillfully coordinated the publications as Publications Chair. It is no exaggeration to say that this meeting simply would not happen without each of their contributions.</p>
<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers accepted. The program committee, under the direction of Program Co-Chairs Crispin Cowan and Giovanni Vigna, has selected an extraordinary set of papers. I thank Crispin and Giovanni and the entire program committee, for their expertise, hard work, and dedication. I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the speakers who present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the National Security Agency (NSA) for patron sponsorship, Google, Afilias, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for silver sponsorships, Microsoft Research and the Dartmouth College Institute for Security Technology Studies for bronze sponsorship, and IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor. I appreciate your dedicated support.</p>
