<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>Network attacks have undergone a dramatic evolution in the past few years. Widespread, Internet-wide attacks that were once motivated by vandalism and bragging rights are now focusing on monetary gains. Worms whose goal was to bring down the network have become stealthy botnets composed of thousands of hosts that provide pay-per-use services to organized crime.</p>
<p>Both the academic community and the commercial sector are striving to provide novel tools and techniques that can counteract these ever-changing threats. The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum where researchers and practitioners can meet and share ideas, which will hopefully lead to a fundamental improvement in our defenses - one that won&rsquo;t be only a reaction to new threats but a new way of thinking about what security means and how security is achieved in networked, distributed systems.</p>
<p>A total of 115 papers were submitted and reviewed by the members of the program committee. These papers were discussed at a meeting held in Portland in November. Selection was based on the originality of the research, applicability of the research to the conference, and the systems nature of the work. In the end, 21 papers were selected for publication for an acceptance rate of approximately 18%. This acceptance rate makes NDSS a highly selective conference.</p>
<p>In addition, the conference program includes two invited talks and a panel on virtualization and security, which brings together experts from both industry and academia to discuss their different perspectives on this hot topic. This is an example of the unique way in which NDSS brings together cutting-edge results from the commercial world with world-class research from the academia.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the program committee, the NDSS steering committee, ISOC staff, and most importantly the authors of all the papers. This conference would not exist without your efforts.</p>
