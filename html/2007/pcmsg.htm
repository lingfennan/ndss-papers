<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>The face of  information security is constantly changing- lately for the worse. Over the  last few years, we&rsquo;ve seen a dramatic rise in the number of incidents as well  as the sophistication of the attacks. Malware and attack &ldquo;developers&rdquo; have become  professionals, and their market size is in the millions (perhaps billions) of  dollars. Information security research and development continues to be a &ldquo;spy vs.  spy&rdquo; engagement where both the attacker and defender react to the actions of  the other in iterative fashion. The only way to break the engagement is for our  community to make a fundamental change in the way we defend hosts and networks.  The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum where researchers and  practitioners can meet and share ideas- hopefully leading to such a fundamental  improvement in our defenses.</p>
<p>A total of 119  papers were submitted and reviewed by the program committee. These papers were  discussed at a two-day meeting held in New    York City in October. Selection was based on the  originality of the research, applicability of the research to the conference,  and the systems nature of the work. In the end, nineteen papers were selected  for publication for an acceptance rate of approximately 15%. This acceptance  rate makes NDSS a highly selective conference.</p>
<p>In addition, we  selected 4 invited talks and a panel, bringing experts from the practical world  of applied security to meet the academic security researchers of NDSS. Each  community has something to offer the other, and we hope for fruitful exchanges  of knowledge, both in the formal sessions and in the all-important &quot;hall track.&quot;</p>
<p>We would like to  thank the program committee, the NDSS steering committee, ISOC staff, and most  importantly the authors of all 119 papers. This conference would not exist  without your efforts. </p>
