<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>I take  great pleasure in welcoming you to the Fourteenth Internet Society Symposium on  Network and Distributed Systems Security.&nbsp;  Change is in the air, and this year you may notice some pretty important  ones.</p>
<p>The biggest  change for NDSS is our shift to a 3-day format.&nbsp;  Our program has always been flexible, adapting to changes in the network  security field.&nbsp; The new format gives us  room to accommodate our expanding research domain.&nbsp; Our program stretches from canonical to  current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing need.&nbsp; This scope is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>
<p>We have  also added a thread of invited talks, starting off with Dr. Vernor Vinge as our  keynote speaker, with later talks, occurring throughout the program, including  such luminaries as David Hutton, John Viega, Tom Liston, and Jim Hoagland.&nbsp; These talks, together with our panel  discussion, hold the promise of important perspectives on our work; changing the  view sometimes helps.</p>
<p>This  symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people.&nbsp; The steering group, which I am pleased to  co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a  course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and  practical.&nbsp; Tom Hutton continues to do a  superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Terry Weigler, with help from  Michele Estadt, is magical with the logistics; the meeting simply would not  happen without them. Doug Szajda skillfully coordinated the publications as  Publications Chair.&nbsp; Finally, I am  grateful for the masterful work of Karen Seo as Publicity Chair.</p>
<p>The quality  of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers selected to  appear.&nbsp; Under the leadership of the  Program Co-Chairs, Bill Arbaugh and Crispin Cowan, the program committee chose  an extraordinary set of papers.&nbsp; I thank  Bill, Crispin, and the entire program committee, for their expertise and  dedication.&nbsp; I also thank the authors who  submitted papers and the speakers who present; you are the core of this  symposium.</p>
<p>I am also  grateful for our sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the  National Security Agency (NSA) for patron sponsorship, Google, Afilias, and the  San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for silver sponsorships, the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Microsoft Research for bronze  sponsorship, and IBM Research and Komoku for contributing sponsorship.&nbsp; I appreciate your dedicated support.</p>
<p>This is my  final year as General Chair.&nbsp; I have been  honored to serve you, and I look forward to our continued growth together.</p>
