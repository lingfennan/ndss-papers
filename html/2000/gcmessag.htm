<BR>
<P>Welcome to the seventh annual Internet Society (ISOC) Network and
Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium!  Each year, this symposium
brings together researchers, designers, implementers, and users of network
and distributed system security technologies to discuss important security
issues, challenges, and solutions.  The NDSS 2000 Program Committee has
assembled an excellent mix of technical papers and panel presentations
that describe promising new approaches to Internet-type security.
Our world continues to become more dependent on the Internet, and the need
for widespread deployment of usable and effective network and distributed
system security solutions is increasing just as rapidly.  NDSS 2000
is an opportunity to have open dialog, share experiences and ideas,
and explore solutions that will protect this valuable resource.</P>

<P>This year's event has been organized by many people who have invested
considerable time and effort.  The NDSS Steering Group, which I co-chaired
with Torryn Brazell from ISOC, has provided overall leadership to ensure
the success of NDSS 2000.  Carla Rosenfeld, Michele Estadt, and the
staff at ISOC have done an outstanding job handling registrations and
many other behind-the-scenes activities.  Tom Hutton has again provided
wonderful local arrangements.  John Kochmar has coordinated inputs from
the authors and panelists to assemble the hard-copy proceedings and the
easy-to-use CD-ROM proceedings.  Dave Balenson has kept us all forging
ahead as he handled a multitude of publicity details.  Doug Maughan worked
overtime to develop a first-rate set of timely tutorials.  The Program
Co-Chairs, Gene Tsudik and Avi Rubin, and the entire Program Committee
are to be commended for their creativity, and diligence in developing an
excellent technical program.  Only with the collective hard work of all
these individuals are we able to make the symposium a success — thanks
to all of you!</P>

<P>Overall sponsorship has been provided for several years by the Internet
Society.  In addition, we have received support this year from a number
of corporate sponsors.  Thanks to the National Security Agency Office of
INFOSEC Research, BBN Technologies, Network Associates, IBM SecureWay,
Zipee.com, NetScreen Technologies, the San Diego Supercomputer Center,
CygnaCom Solutions, Daedal Enterprises, and AXENT Technologies for
sponsoring NDSS 2000.</P>

<P>Finally, I would like to thank all of the authors who will
present their papers, the panelists who will share their knowledge and
experiences, and everyone who attends NDSS 2000 for your contributions
and participation.  I am confident that the professional contacts you make
at this symposium, the presentations, and these proceedings will provide
ideas and insights that you can apply to your own security efforts.</P>
