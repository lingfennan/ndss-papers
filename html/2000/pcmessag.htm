<br>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a great pleasure to usher in the first
NDSS of the new millennium! As a direct result of the worldwide
"Internet-ization," the last decade has seen an unprecedented growth in
the importance of computer and network security as well as increased
awareness of various risks, threats and attacks. Consequently, our
collective mission becomes much harder as the relevant technical advances
in the research community are being utilized faster and scrutinized more
than ever before.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A total of 51 submissions were received this year.
The average submission quality was very high despite the increasing
number of competing venues. Submissions came from around the world,
attesting to the international flavor of NDSS.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The program committee met on Friday the 13th (of
August). Despite the ominous date, the meeting was an overwhelming
success resulting in the selection of 15 outstanding papers on a broad
range of subjects. They represent the state-of-the-art in network and
distributed systems security and demonstrate the talents and dedication
of the authors.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many individuals are responsible for the success
of NDSS 2000. First and foremost, we are grateful to the authors of
<i>all</i> submitted papers for their patronage and for the hard work
invested in submissions. The authors are both the backbone and the target
audience of this conference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the program committee have done a
wonderful job and we cannot thank them enough for their time and effort
in reviewing papers, participating in the PC meeting and assisting in
many related activities.  It has been a pleasure and an honor to work
with them. We are equally grateful to the delegated reviewers for their
selfless community service.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A special word of thanks to Steve Welke who, as General
Chair, shared his knowledge and experience on numerous occasions. We
are grateful to the Publicity Chair, Dave Balenson, who has done --
once again -- a great job promoting and advertising NDSS. We also thank
Doug Maughan, the Tutorials Chair, for putting together an outstanding
selection of tutorials on timely and important topics.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This conference marks the fourth and final year of
my official affiliation with NDSS: first as PC member and then as Program
Co-Chair. I am happy to see the evolution of NDSS: its increased popularity
as well as the quality and maturity of the technical program. It has been
and remains one of the very few "must-attend" conferences in the field.
I am very proud of my affiliation with NDSS and I sincerely appreciate
the opportunity to serve as a PC member and a Program Chair.</P></td>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a pleasure chairing the NDSS 2000 conference.
This conference has always held a special place in my heart. I attended
the very first workshop back in 1993 and every symposium since, with the
exception of 1994 (when I had to defend my thesis at the same time as the
conference). I look forward to working with Paul Van Oorschot on the 2001
conference and to continuing the effort to keep this as one of the best
security conferences around.</td>
