<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>

<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you all back to the beautiful Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa on Mission Bay in San Diego for the Internet Society's Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS'14). 

<p>I would like to thank the Catamaran Resort for providing such an excellent venue for us over the years and for this, our 21st year.   From our very first workshop and continuing today, NDSS has striven to maintain the superior quality of our technical program. Our research domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid theoretical foundations. The program stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing needs. This scope, along with a willingness to consider potentially controversial or unusual research, is the essential beauty of NDSS.

<p>This year we have added optional SENT and USEC full day Workshops (Security of Emerging Network Technologies and Usable Security) on Sunday.  These will bring together academic and industry researchers to discuss security problems, challenges, and potential security solutions of emerging networking technologies such as Software Defined Networks,  Named-Data-Networking and Cellular networks. 

<p>The main program for this year packs a lot into three days and includes 12 sessions and 55 original research papers. They cover a variety of current topics such as issues with password reuse, authentication methods, biometrics, cloud computing, distributed systems and networks, web security and privacy, intrusion detection and attack analysis, anonymity, and more. Our keynote speaker this year is Christopher Hadnagy, Chief Human Hacker of Social-Engineer, Inc.  He will talk about "Hacking the Human".

<p>Although the symposium revolves around the technical presentations, there is far more to the experience. Take advantage of the hall track, the reception, the lunches, and the Tuesday banquet to meet new colleagues. This year we have added a poster session to the reception.  Please check them out.  Participate in the discussions.  And finally, remember to save some time to take advantage of our fantastic geographic location.

<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. I would like to thank the NDSS steering group for charting a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical. David Balenson, one of NDSS's original steering group members rejoins us this year as Publications Chair and has skillfully assembled the Proceedings. Kevin Craemer again has done a wonderful job of finding sponsors and helping plan and publicize the conference and Terry Weigler, as always has done a fantastic job dealing with each and every one of you for Registration. This meeting is as enjoyable and as successful as it is because of the efforts of these people &#8212; it is no exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen without each of their contributions.

<p>The quality of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers accepted. The program committee, under the direction of Program Chair Lujo Bauer of Carnegie Mellon University, has done a fantastic job and has selected an extraordinary set of papers. I thank Lujo and the entire program committee for their expertise, hard work, and dedication. I also want to thank Li Erran Li from Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent and Adrian Perrig for organizing and chairing the SENT workshop and Matthew Smith of Leibniz University Hannover and David Wagner of UC Berkeley for the organizing and chairing of the USEC workshop.  Lastly, I also thank the authors who submitted papers and the speakers who are present; YOU are the core of this symposium.

<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors, as it would be impossible to hold such an event without them. Our sponsors are the Internet Society for overall sponsorship, Cisco Systems for Gold Sponsorship; Afilias, Qualcomm, the San Diego Supercomputer Center @ UCSD (SDSC), and Samsung Knox for Silver sponsorship; Research at Google, Internet2, and Microsoft Research for Bronze sponsorships, and IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor. The conference is organized by the Internet Society, in cooperation with USENIX.

<p>I would also like to thank my organization, the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California San Diego, for supporting my involvement with this symposium for the last twenty-one years. Finally, I want all of you to know that I view it as a great honor to chair this conference, one where the attendees and speakers are some of the finest minds in computer network security.
