<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>

<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 21st Annual Network & Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2014), held at the Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa in San Diego, CA, United States on February 23-26, 2014. NDSS fosters information exchange among researchers and practitioners of network and distributed system security. The target audience includes those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on actual system design and implementation. A major goal is to encourage and enable the Internet community to apply, deploy, and advance the state of network and distributed systems security technologies.

<p>This year NDSS received 290 valid submissions (i.e., not counting papers that clearly violated the submission guidelines). Submissions were evaluated on the basis of their technical quality, novelty, and significance. Papers went through three rounds of review, and, new this year, authors were given the chance to see and respond to reviews after the second round. Reviewing culminated in a one-and-a-half-day in-person program committee meeting, at which 55 papers (approximately 19%) were selected to appear at NDSS.

<p>Organizing a conference as large as NDSS is a substantial endeavor, and I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed his or her time and effort. I'd also like to specifically thank a few individuals who made particular contributions to NDSS 2014. Kevin Craemer handled most of the logistics of organizing the conference, as well as the more challenging task of shepherding a new program chair. Engin Kirda served as the shadow chair; my job was much easier because he was there to catch any oversights. Thanks chiefly to the efforts and persistence of David Balenson, the Publications Chair, NDSS 2014 proceedings and papers have been assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs), enabling easier search and indexing. I'd also like to thank everyone who served on the program committee; it was my pleasure and honor to have worked with you to put together the program for NDSS 2014. Also crucial to the success of NDSS are the authors who submitted papers &#8212; thank you! &#8212; and the attendees. Welcome to NDSS, and I hope you find the program informative and stimulating.
