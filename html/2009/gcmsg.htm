<h3>General Chair's Message</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Sixteenth Internet Society Symposium on Network and Distributed Systems Security. After two consecutive years of significant organizational changes to NDSS, I am pleased that we have retained many of the scheduling and program features that helped make last year's meeting a success.</p>
<p>One feature that has remained consistent during the history of NDSS is the superior quality  of the technical program. Our research  domain continues to emphasize practical applications of security based on solid  theoretical foundations. The program  stretches from canonical to current, and includes both the theoretical and the pressing need. This scope is the essential beauty of NDSS.</p>
<p>The program for this year includes sessions that cover web security, distributed systems,  intrusion detection, traffic protection and infrastructure security, host  security, and authentication and accountability. We are also fortunate to have two  distinguished invited speakers in Ivan Arce, who will provide perspectives on the past and future of penetration testing, and Brian Chess, who will discuss  the advantages of static analysis for creating secure software. We will also hear a presentation on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), an experimental suite of infrastructure that is expected to allow researchers to build and study  networks in ways that are not currently possible.</p>
<p>Though the conference revolves around the technical presentation, there is much more to the experience. The hall track, meeting  new colleagues, asking questions, and participating in discussions are  invaluable parts of the process of disseminating and discussing information. Take advantage of them. Remember also to take advantage at  some point of the superior geographic location.</p>
<p>This symposium is possible only through the hard work of many people. The steering  group, which I am pleased to co-chair with Lynn St. Amour from the Internet Society, expertly charts a course for the conference that keeps its focus current, relevant, and practical. Tom Hutton has once again done a superb job of coordinating local arrangements. Kevin Craemer has done a wonderful job of helping plan and publicize the conference. Terry Weigler is magical  with the logistics. Barry Lawson skillfully coordinated the publications as Publications Chair. Patrick Traynor has expertly handled the Works-in-Progress session arrangements. And Gary McGraw has been invaluable in helping to select and secure our invited speakers. This meeting is as enjoyable and successful  as it is because of the efforts of these people -- it is no exaggeration to say that NDSS simply would not happen without each of their contributions.</p>
<p>The quality  of this conference directly depends upon the quality of the papers  accepted. The program committee, under the direction of Program Chair Giovanni Vigna, has selected an extraordinary set of papers. I thank Giovanni and the entire program committee for their expertise, hard work and dedication. I also thank the authors who submitted papers  and the speakers who present; you are the core of this symposium.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for our sponsors: The Internet Society for overall sponsorship, the National Security Agency (NSA) for patron sponsorship, Afilias, Cisco, Microsoft Research, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) for silver sponsorships, Google for bronze  sponsorship, and IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine as our media sponsor. I appreciate your dedicated support.</p>
