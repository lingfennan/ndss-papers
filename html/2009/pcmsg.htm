<h3>Program Chair's Message </h3>
<p>In the past  few years, the security community has witnessed a dramatic shift in the modus  operandi of computer criminals, who are creating a new underground economy  where goods such as stolen identities and compromised bank accounts are bought  and sold like any other commodity. Also, in recent times the use of network  attacks in the context of clashes between nation-states has been steadily  increasing, suggesting that network security will play an important role in  future conflicts. Therefore, the network security community is working hard to understand, analyze, and develop solutions to these ever-changing threats.</p>
<p>The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum where researchers and practitioners can meet and share ideas, which will hopefully lead to a fundamental improvement in our defenses - one that won&rsquo;t be only a reaction to the latest, popular threats but a new way of thinking about what security means and how security is achieved in networked, distributed systems.</p>
<p>A total of 170 papers were submitted and reviewed by the members of the program committee. These papers were discussed at a meeting held in Alexandria, Virginia,  in October 2008. Selection was based on the originality of the research, suitability of the research to the conference topics, and the systems nature of the work. In the end, 20 papers were selected for publication for an acceptance  rate of approximately 11%. This acceptance rate makes NDSS one of the most selective conferences in the field of computer security.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the program committee, the NDSS steering committee, the ISOC  staff, and most importantly the authors of all the papers. This conference would not exist without your efforts.</p>
